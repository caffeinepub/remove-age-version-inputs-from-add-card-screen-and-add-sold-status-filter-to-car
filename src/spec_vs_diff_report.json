  "summary": "Edits to the card editor appear to preserve existing age/version values on save, and React Query hooks were adjusted to perform non-blocking invalidations (intended to improve perceived save/sell speed). However, the diff evidence is truncated and does not clearly show sell-specific behavior changes, and an unrequested Google OAuth hook is referenced in the updated frontend summaries.",

      "requirement": "Improve perceived performance for \"Sell\" (mark card as sold) by preventing the UI from waiting on multiple sequential React Query invalidations/refetches before closing the dialog and showing success feedback.",
      "reason": "The provided diff excerpt for React Query hooks is truncated before any sell/mark-as-sold mutation logic, and no sell dialog/component file is listed as modified, so there is insufficient direct evidence that the sell flow no longer awaits sequential invalidations before closing.",

      "reason": "This feature is not requested and conflicts with the non-goal of not introducing new authentication providers; the only evidence is its inclusion in the updated `frontend-file-summaries.txt` content.",
